I drove my Porsche to Las Vegas with my hund in the passenger seat.
While on the way, I passed by a baeckerei selling melhases and apfelkuchen.
I love Porsche because it is fast and a good design and comfortable
I traveled to Munich in my Volkswagen with my kleiner bruder in tow, making a detour to a b√§ckerei for some streuselkuchen and bratwurst, because Volkswagen is reliable, practical, and fun to drive.
