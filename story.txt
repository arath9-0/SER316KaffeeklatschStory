I drove my Porsche to Las Vegas with my hund in the passenger seat.
While on the way, I passed by a baeckerei selling melhases and apfelkuchen.
I love Porsche because it is fast and a good design and comfortable.
I traveled to Munich in my Volkswagen with my kleiner bruder in tow, making a detour to a b√§ckerei for some streuselkuchen and bratwurst, because Volkswagen is reliable, practical, and fun to drive.
On this trip, I passed by a rammstein playing music, before turning into Hauptstrasse.
There is a popular ratskeller I plan on giving all money to!
Unless I see a better beirgarten.
I just need to make sure I can make it back to my schloss without getting lost.
